## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have already reviewed existing [Issues](https://github.com/andrewdmaclean/awesome-feature-management/issues).

In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/andrewdmaclean/awesome-feature-management/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Adding something to an awesome list

If you have something awesome to contribute to this awesome list, here is how you'll do it.

You'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)!

1. Click on the `readme.md` file: 
2. Now click on the edit icon.
3. You can start editing the text of the file in the in-browser editor. Make sure you follow guidelines above. You can use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).
4. Say why you're proposing the changes, and then click on "Propose file change".
5. Submit the [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)!

#### Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:
- Make sure that your submission is really awesome. Awesome lists are curations of the best, not everything.
- Try to add a short description of the link you are adding by following the convention. Try to credit the author(s) by linking a Twitter/GitHub profile (or website/portfolio):

```markdown
- [Name of the resource](<link>): <short description> by [@<author1 nickname>](<link to author1 profile>) & [@<author2 nickname>](<link to author2 profile>)
```

- Choose the best link of all, that makes the navigation and the understanding of the resource the easiest possible. (i.e. prefer linking a GitHub repository over its demo link, moreover if the demo does no link back to the repository. The demo link is certainly linked anyway in the repo)
- Ensure that your submission is in the right category. If it does not fit anywhere, propose a new category or sub-category that we will review in the PR.

#### Updating your Pull Request

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. 
  
There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
