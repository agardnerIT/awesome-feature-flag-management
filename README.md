## About
[Feature Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/concept-feature-management) is a modern software-development practice that decouples feature release from code deployment and enables quick changes to feature availability on demand. It uses a technique called feature flags (also known as feature toggles and feature switches) to dynamically administer a feature's lifecycle.

## Platforms
- [ConfigCat](https://configcat.com) - A hosted service for feature flag and configuration management. 
- [DevCycle](https://devcycle.com) - A tool for modern development teams who are looking to graduate from their current feature flag tool. 
- [Flagship](https://flagship.io) - Feature management and feature experimentation platform.
