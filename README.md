## About
[Feature Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/concept-feature-management) is a modern software-development practice that decouples feature release from code deployment and enables quick changes to feature availability on demand. It uses a technique called feature flags (also known as feature toggles and feature switches) to dynamically administer a feature's lifecycle.
